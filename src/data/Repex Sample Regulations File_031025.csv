The study reveals that banks are proactively conducting scenario analyses for credit risks, encompassing both transition and physical risks, and are beginning to integrate greenhouse gas emissions data into their lending assessments. Non-life insurers focus primarily on acute physical risks, such as natural disasters, in their underwriting and investment activities, while life insurers are increasingly analyzing chronic physical risks, like long-term temperature increases, particularly concerning their investment portfolios. However, the study identifies inconsistencies across sectors in the scope and methodology of scenario analyses, often influenced by each sector's perception of material risks and data availability. The report suggests that as climate-related data becomes more accessible and analytical methods advance, there is potential for financial institutions to broaden their scenario analyses to encompass a wider array of climate-related risks across various business areas.

The PRA identified significant shortcomings in firms' approaches, including inadequate data on the locations of insured or mortgaged properties, limited scenario analyses, and a general failure to treat climate change as a strategic risk beyond reputational concerns. To address these issues, the PRA has mandated internal climate risk reviews, with a follow-up assessment scheduled in six months. The guidance emphasizes the need for firms to improve their identification, measurement, and management of both physical risks (like flooding) and transition risks associated with the shift to a low-carbon economy. The PRA warns that without addressing these gaps, financial institutions could face losses that undermine their safety and soundness, potentially leading to higher costs and reduced financial access for high-risk properties and carbon-intensive companies .

The MSX underwent a restructure in 2001 and its key mandate currently focuses on facilitating the listing and trading of securities in Oman and monitoring and regulating the Omani securities market.
In issuing the Guidelines, the MSX set out 30 metrics to measure a public company’s impact on environmental sustainability, societal responsibility and governance matters, including the measurement of carbon emissions.
The Guidelines are intended to promote transparency and robustness of ESG reporting by encouraging voluntary reporting in 2024 (for activities conducted in 2023). Reporting will be mandatory for public companies from 2025 onwards, with the first mandatory reports to be filed by 31 March 2025. Moreover, the Guidelines also introduce regional-level environmental responsibility initiatives, such as reducing single-use plastics and paper waste while promoting recycling and clean energy use, as well as, underlines Oman's ongoing commitment in establishing an inclusive and sustainable economic development.
From 2025, public companies will be required to publish standalone ESG reports according to Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Universal Standards.

Reporting is at the facility level except for certain suppliers of fossil fuels and industrial greenhouse gases.

The emissions reporting requirements for direct emitting facilities are specified in 98.3(c)(4) and the GHG reporting requirements for suppliers are specified in 98.3(c). On May 6, 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) implemented a final rule to enhance methane emissions reporting standards for petroleum and natural gas systems within the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program.

Key updates include:
Net-Zero Roadmaps: Companies must outline detailed plans to achieve Switzerland’s 2050 net-zero target. Financial institutions will have additional responsibilities, including setting interim science-based emission reduction targets and aligning financial flows with climate objectives.
Expanded Reporting Standards: Organizations can meet their disclosure obligations by following internationally recognized frameworks like the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) or the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).

The SAF credit applies to a qualified fuel mixture containing sustainable aviation fuel for certain sales or uses in calendar years 2023 and 2024. The SAF credit is $1.25 for each gallon of sustainable aviation fuel in a qualified mixture. To qualify for the credit, the sustainable aviation fuel must have a minimum reduction of 50% in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, there is a supplemental credit of one cent for each percent that the reduction exceeds 50%, for a maximum increase of $0.50. The IRA provides two methods to determine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions reduction percentage (emissions reduction percentage) that can be used to qualify for and calculate the credit. These are the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) method and any similar method that meets certain requirements of the Clean Air Act (CAA). Additionally, the IRA requires certain aspects of each method to be certified by an unrelated party. The notice provides additional safe harbors using the Environmental Protection Agency's Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and related guidance. The RFS program uses a methodology similar to CORSIA and meets the requirements of the CAA, and the safe harbors in this notice can be used to calculate the emissions reduction percentage and for the corresponding unrelated party certification for the SAF credit. Further, this notice explains that the current Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model of the Argonne National Laboratory and other GREET-based models do not currently satisfy the applicable statutory requirements for the SAF credit. Finally, this notice announces that the Department of Energy is collaborating with other federal agencies to develop a modified version of the GREET model that would satisfy the statutory requirements for the SAF credit.

This regulation includes provisions for green and sustainable bonds, mandating disclosure requirements to improve market transparency for environmentally and socially responsible investments. It obliges banks to provide information on the environmental and social impact of these bonds, supporting investors' decision-making aligned with sustainability and social responsibility values. Reflecting global sustainable finance frameworks like the Green Bond Principles (GBP) and the Sustainability Bond Guidelines (SBG) by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA), this regulation incorporates these principles into Mexico's banking regulations. It promotes transparency, disclosure, and reporting practices, enabling accurate assessment of investments' environmental and social impacts. By requiring disclosures on green and sustainable bonds, the regulation encourages banks to incorporate environmental and social considerations into financing activities. This aligns with sustainable policy development efforts, addressing challenges like climate change and social inequality. The CNBV aims to create a resilient, responsible banking sector that supports societal goals while managing liquidity risks. The regulation marks progress in incorporating sustainability into Mexico's financial regulatory framework.

Internal Control Standards: Financial companies are required to establish internal control standards, designating responsibilities and procedures for overseeing green finance activities, including appointing internal supervisors.
Determination of Green Activities: Financial companies can assess the appropriateness of green economic activities on behalf of businesses, addressing gaps in businesses' understanding of K-taxonomy and reducing their burden.

It supports Aotearoa New Zealand to meet its emissions reduction goals by putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions. Businesses must surrender a carbon credit – an ‘New Zealand emission unit’ (NZU) – for every tonne of climate pollution they emit. Businesses can purchase NZUs through Government auctions held four times per year. They can also trade NZUs through the secondary market. The Government makes annual updates to auction limits and price control settings for NZUs. ,"The NZ ETS covers six greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs). All gases are treated and accounted for the same in the NZ ETS, using the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) standard unit. The Government sets and reduces the number of units supplied into the scheme over time. This limits the quantity that emitters can emit, in line with New Zealand’s emission reduction targets. All sectors of New Zealand's economy, apart from agriculture, pay for their emissions through their NZ ETS surrender obligations. The agriculture sector reports its emissions through the NZ ETS but does not have surrender obligations. Schedule 3 of the Climate Change Response Act sets forth the activities that are included under the emissions trading scheme for the following sectors: forestry, liquid fossil fuels, stationary energy, industrial processes, agriculture, and waste. Owners of coal mines producing or stockpiling more than 2,000 tonnes of coal per year are required to participate in the scheme.",,,,,,,,,Yes,Mandatory,,Climate change: GHG emissions,,,01/09/2008,,,,,,,,,,08/02/2024,,,,,,,,

Additionally, it mandates Member States to classify offences causing particularly severe environmental damage as ""qualified offences,"" which will carry harsher penalties for both individuals and legal entities. The Directive also establishes a structured penalty system, including imprisonment and financial fines ranging from €24 to €40 million or based on the company’s global turnover.

To enhance enforcement, the Directive strengthens investigative and policing capacities through specialized training, cross-border cooperation, and dedicated national strategies. It also introduces measures to protect environmental defenders and facilitate their participation in legal proceedings. Additional provisions cover aspects such as incitement, aiding and abetting, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, as well as asset confiscation, jurisdiction, and limitation periods, ensuring a comprehensive framework for preventing and prosecuting environmental crimes across Member States.

The main objective of this environmental measure is to avoid carbon leakage. It encourages partner countries to establish carbon pricing policies to fight climate change.For that purpose, CBAM targets imports of carbon-intensive products, in full compliance with international trade rules, to prevent offsetting the EU's greenhouse gas emissions reduction efforts through imports of products manufactured in non-EU countries, where climate change policies are less ambitious than in the European Union. It helps prevent the relocation of the production or the import of carbon-intensive products. The products of the following sectors will be covered by CBAM: cement, aluminium, fertilisers, electric energy production, iron and steel.
The EU Omnibus proposed some changes like exempt small importers from CBAM obligations, mostly SMEs and individuals. These are importers who import small quantities of CBAM goods, representing very small quantities of embedded emissions entering the EU from third countries. Also, propose measures to simplify the small occasional importations of CBAM goods, below the maximum threshold of 50 tonnes per year. This threshold corresponds to approximately 80 tonnes of CO2 equivalent on average per importer. These importers will no longer be subject to any CBAM obligation. For those importers that remain in the CBAM scope, the proposed changes will facilitate compliance with the reporting requirements and aim at simplifying the authorisation of declarants, the calculation of emissions, reporting requirements and compliance with the financial liability. This will be coupled with measures making CBAM more effective, by strengthening anti-abuse provisions and developing a joint anti-circumvention strategy together with national authorities.
